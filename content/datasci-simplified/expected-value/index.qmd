## Powerball Lottery

:::{.incremental}
- Powerball is an American lottery game offered by 45 states.
- Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) 
matrix from which winning numbers are chosen.
- Each play costs $2, or $3 with the Power Play option.
- It offers various prizes for matching one to five white balls or the Powerball itself.
- The jackpot could make winners instant millionaires.

:::{.incremental}
- Don't play Powerball.
- If you do play Powerball, don't play Powerball unless the jackpot is really big.
- And if you buy tickets for a massive jackpot, try to reduce the odds you'll
have to share your haul; pick numbers other players won't. Don't pick your birthday.
Don't pick numbers that won a previous draw. Don't pick numbers that form a nice pattern
on the ticket. And for God's sake, don't pick numbers you find in a fortune cookie. (You
know they don't put different numbers in every cookie, right?)

## Question


- How big does the jackpot have to be to make it worth playing?



## Expected Value

- The expected value describes the average outcome or mean of a random variable 
over a large number of trials or occurrences. 
- It provides a measure of the center of the probability distribution of a random variable.


### Discrete Variable

$$E(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} x p(x)$$



### Continuous Variable

$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx$$


## Example

A fair six-sided die has six possible outcomes, each of which is equally likely to occur. 
The outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6. 
What is the expected value of the die?

. . .

**Solution:**

In theory, 

$$E(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} x p(x) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 3.5$$


## Visualizing Expected Value

```{r}
#| echo: true

set.seed(42)
n = 1000
x = sample(1:6, n, replace = TRUE)
y = cumsum(x) / seq_along(x) # seq(1, 1000, 1)
df = tibble(x = 1:n, y = y)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  ylim(0, 6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Expected Value of a Die Roll", x = "Number of Rolls", y = "Expected Value")

```

set.seed(42)
n = 100000
x = sample(1:6, n, replace = TRUE)
y = cumsum(x) / seq_along(x)

df = tibble(x = 1:n, y = y)


ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  ylim(0, 6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Expected Value of a Die Roll", x = "Number of Rolls", y = "Expected Value")

```

## Law of Large Numbers

- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that the average of the results obtained 
from a large number of independent identical trials should be close to the expected 
value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.
